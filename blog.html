      </p>
      <p>solving math's numerous problems during my three hour free period has been reviewed as a possible solution, but there are usually much more pressing matters to attend to at this time! including the harrowing hypotheticals of "what if somebody is looking at me" or "what if someone says something to me" </p><p>
      they aren't, and they won't, but a mortifying thought nonetheless! indeed, deserving of my full and undivided attention !

         <p>one time i was sitting down when a group of people walked into the room i was in. i don't recall exactly how their conversation went but it was about what their favorite bird was. what i do remember is one replying with something along the lines of "Definitely Pelicans" and his enthusiasm instantly captivated me </p>
         <p>i think my favorite are crows. their presence is more substantial than that of the fleeting songbird and i see them in the same places sometimes. Once one of them ate some Potater chips i tossed him. 
         their sound is interesting and i think they seem   Kind</p>
         <h3>11/3/2022</h3>
        <p>does anybody else struggle with not being able to be themself around other people? wish i had a disclaimer that the way i act is not how i rly am or would ever want to be. but am i entitled to some separate, internal identity that my outward behavior is only a flawed imitation of, screwed up by innumerable "external" factors - physical appearance, voice, anxieties and insecurities, etc? could i walk around saying that im not ackshually a massive loser, just... scared? and socially inept, and generally lost? maybe more importantly, should anyone listen?

            <p>today is october second of twenty-twenty-two and i am feeling sad today. i am playing through the dlc expansions of dark souls II: scholar of the first sin, chronologically by release date, and i cannot tell whether or not this is making it worse. </p>
            
            <h3>10/1/2022</h3>
            <p>goooob morning guys gals and gamers. autumn is among us (2018) and my room has become but an arctic wasteland, a frozen hellscape, an icy tomb - a snowy grave, if you will.
            i have taken to wearing slippers in the house. if temperatures continue to decrease i will soon be forced to additionally acquire a pointed nightcap with a small pom-pom at the top.
            
            </p>
            
            <h3>9/30/2022 Part 2</h3>
            <p>sooo its getting pretty late now and i am about to go to bed. but i just wanted to let my horde of loyal followers know that i learned how to make an aseprite script today! i will let yall guess the 
            piece of content i made with it because it can be found somewhere on this very site!</p>
            
            <h3>9/30/2022</h3>
            <p>hey every. whats up guys. today is friday and i dont have any school how epic! yesterday i put up this new and improved (?) site and today im adding some more stuff. </p>
            <p>i learnt how to do an iframe and i love them! just like me when light equipment load! i can put as many pages as i want and i dont have to copy and paste the navigation to every single one.
            however there is the issue of the page flickering because you get taken to a whole new page when you click the links. i saw somebody who did some other method where it was all just one page
            and some of the content gets swapped or something? idk how to do that</p>
            <p>i want to add some buttons and some gifs and some etc. but right now the page looks very minimal and adding other goofiness will make it considerably worse until there is enough nonsense for it to not look
            minimal anymore. there is a small hill to get over so to speak when it comes to the level of tomfoolery. on a graph of the function relating the level of shenanigans on a webpage to said webpage's good-looking-ness there is a 
            massive trough starting at x = the amount of silliness on this page right now and yet i am determined to cross this treacherous valley with foolishness never before seen on the world wide web. for this is the 
            fate of brave little kittens and kittys.</p>
